This architecture is called the client–server model.
servers are employed as listed below 
  => 1 server ()
  => 1 web server (Nginx)
  => 1 application server
  => 1 application files (your code base)
  => 1 database (MySQL)
  => 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8

2) What is the role of the domain name (same as to this project) Naming server (DNS) IP address is 8.8.8.8
Domain names serve to identify Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services, with a text-based label that is easier to 
memorize than the numerical addresses used in the Internet protocols. A domain name may represent entire collections of such resources or individual instances.
