1) What is a server
In computing, a server is a piece of computer hardware or software that provides functionality for other programs or devices, called "clients". 
This architecture is called the clientâ€“server model.
servers are employed as listed below 
  => 1 server ()
  => 1 web server (Nginx)
  => 1 application server
  => 1 application files (your code base)
  => 1 database (MySQL)
  => 1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8

2) What is the role of the domain name (same as to this project)
Domain names serve to identify Internet resources, such as computers, networks, and services, with a text-based label that is easier to 
memorize than the numerical addresses used in the Internet protocols. A domain name may represent entire collections of such resources or individual instances.
for this queastion 
The type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com (8.8.8.8)
www.foobar.com uses an A record. This can be checked by running dig www.foobar.com.
